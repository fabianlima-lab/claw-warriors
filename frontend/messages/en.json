    "whatIsBody": "ClawWarriors is a no-code platform for deploying personalized AI agents. Instead of generic chatbots, you choose an RPG-style warrior character that becomes your personal AI assistant.\n\nYour warrior lives on messaging platforms like Telegram and can help with everything from daily planning to research to creative brainstorming.\n\nEach warrior has a unique personality class (Guardian, Scholar, Creator, Strategist, or Sentinel), persistent memory across conversations, customizable behavior through the Soul Forge, and the ability to run automated tasks on a schedule.\n\nThink of it as your own AI companion that actually knows you and works the way you want.",

    "choosingWarriorTitle": "Choosing Your Warrior",
    "choosingWarriorBody": "When you sign up, you'll choose a warrior from 5 personality classes, each with 3 character options:\n\nGuardian — Focused on health, wellness, and daily routines. Great as a personal wellness coach.\n\nScholar — Built for research, learning, and analysis. Your personal research assistant.\n\nCreator — Oriented toward writing, ideas, and creativity. Your creative partner.\n\nStrategist — Specializes in planning, strategy, and problem-solving. Your strategic advisor.\n\nSentinel — Expert in security, monitoring, and protection. Your digital watchdog.\n\nEach warrior within a class has a distinct personality and speaking style. Browse the character cards during onboarding — you can read their intro quote and see their stat distribution.\n\nPro Tribe users can deploy up to 3 warriors simultaneously, each on a different channel.",

    "connectTelegramTitle": "Connecting Telegram",
    "connectTelegramBody": "After deploying your warrior, you'll need to connect a messaging channel. Here's how to connect Telegram:\n\n1. Open Telegram and search for @ClawWarriorsBot\n2. Tap 'Start' to begin the conversation\n3. On the ClawWarriors website, go to the channel connection page\n4. Click 'Generate Code' to get a 6-digit connection code\n5. Send that code to @ClawWarriorsBot in Telegram\n6. You'll see a confirmation message once connected\n\nThe connection is instant — once linked, any message you send to the bot goes directly to your warrior, and responses come back through the same chat.\n\nYou can disconnect and reconnect channels at any time from your dashboard settings.",

    "firstConvoTitle": "Your First Conversation",
    "firstConvoBody": "Once your warrior is deployed and your channel is connected, just send a message in Telegram to start chatting.\n\nYour warrior will respond in character, using its personality class and tone. Here are some tips for your first conversation:\n\nIntroduce yourself — Tell your warrior your name, what you do, and what you're looking for help with. This gets stored in Deep Memory.\n\nBe specific — Instead of 'help me be productive', try 'I need help organizing my morning routine as a freelance designer'.\n\nSet expectations — Tell your warrior how you prefer communication: casual or formal, brief or detailed, encouraging or direct.\n\nExplore features — Ask your warrior what it can do. It knows about its own capabilities.\n\nYour warrior remembers information across conversations, so the more you chat, the more personalized it becomes.",

    "soulForgeTitle": "Soul Forge — Custom Instructions",
    "soulForgeBody": "The Soul Forge lets you shape your warrior's personality with custom instructions. Think of it as a set of rules your warrior always follows.\n\nTo access it, go to Dashboard and tap the Soul button.\n\nThe Soul Forge has 6 structured fields:\n\nPersonality & Tone — How your warrior communicates. Example: 'Be warm and encouraging, use casual language, add humor when appropriate.'\n\nUser Context — Background about you. Example: 'I'm a 28-year-old product designer based in Lisbon. I work remotely for a startup.'\n\nGoals & Priorities — What you're working toward. Example: 'Launching my freelance business, learning Portuguese, running a half marathon.'\n\nCommunication Preferences — How you want responses. Example: 'Keep responses under 200 words. Use bullet points for lists. Ask follow-up questions.'\n\nDo's — Things your warrior should always do. Example: 'Always suggest next steps. Remind me of deadlines. Celebrate small wins.'\n\nDon'ts — Things your warrior should never do. Example: 'Never be condescending. Don't use corporate jargon. Never recommend meditation.'\n\nEach field accepts up to 500 characters. Changes take effect immediately — your warrior uses the updated instructions in the very next message.\n\nAvailable on Pro and Pro Tribe plans.",

    "deepMemoryTitle": "Deep Memory — Persistent Knowledge",
    "deepMemoryBody": "Deep Memory gives your warrior the ability to remember important facts about you across every conversation.\n\nHow it works:\nAfter each conversation, your warrior automatically extracts key information — preferences, facts about your life, standing instructions, and conversation summaries. These are saved and injected into every future conversation.\n\nMemory categories:\n- Preferences: Things you like or dislike, communication style\n- Facts: Personal details, context about your life and work\n- Instructions: Standing orders ('always do X', 'never do Y')\n- Summaries: Key takeaways from past conversations\n\nViewing your memories:\nGo to Dashboard and tap the Memory button to see everything your warrior remembers. Memories are listed with their category, date, and source.\n\nManaging memories:\nYou can delete individual memories or clear all memories at once. Deleting a memory means your warrior will no longer reference that information.\n\nMemory limits by plan:\n- Trial: 50 memories\n- Pro: 200 memories\n- Pro Tribe: 500 memories per warrior",

    "pulseCheckTitle": "Pulse Check — Proactive Messages",
    "pulseCheckBody": "Pulse Check lets your warrior reach out to you proactively at scheduled times, instead of only responding when you message first.\n\nFour built-in pulse slots:\n\nMorning Check-in (8:00 AM) — A brief start-of-day message, referencing anything relevant from memory.\n\nMidday Nudge (12:00 PM) — A midday check-in, asking if you need help or sharing a useful tip.\n\nEvening Wrap-up (5:00 PM) — An end-of-day summary of what you worked on and anything pending.\n\nNight Wind-down (9:00 PM) — A casual evening message with a thought or recommendation.\n\nSetup:\n1. Go to Dashboard and tap the Pulse button\n2. Set your timezone (auto-detected from your browser)\n3. Toggle each pulse on or off\n4. Customize the prompt for each pulse — tell your warrior what to say\n5. Use the Test Now button to preview what it sends\n\nPulse messages arrive through your connected messaging channel (Telegram).\n\nAll times are in your local timezone.\n\nTrial users get 1 pulse slot. Pro users get all 4. Pro Tribe users get all 4 per warrior.",

    "warRhythmsTitle": "War Rhythms — Automated Tasks",
    "warRhythmsBody": "War Rhythms are automated recurring tasks that your warrior executes on a schedule. Unlike Pulse Check (which sends check-in messages), Rhythms are task-focused — your warrior performs a specific job and reports the result.\n\nExamples:\n- 'Summarize my week every Friday at 5pm'\n- 'Research the latest AI news every Monday morning'\n- 'Remind me about my goals every Wednesday'\n\nCreating a rhythm:\n1. Go to Dashboard and tap the Rhythms button\n2. Tap 'Add Rhythm'\n3. Enter a name and the task instructions\n4. Type a schedule in natural language (e.g., 'every weekday at 9am')\n5. The AI converts it to a precise schedule and shows you a preview\n6. Tap 'Create Rhythm'\n\nSuggested rhythms:\nThe page also shows personalized suggestions based on your conversation patterns and memories. Tap 'Show Suggestions' to see them, and 'Add' to create one instantly.\n\nManaging rhythms:\n- Toggle rhythms on/off with the switch\n- 'Run Now' triggers immediate execution\n- View the last result in the expandable section\n- Delete rhythms you no longer need\n\nTrial: 0 rhythms (Pro required)\nPro: Up to 5 rhythms\nPro Tribe: Up to 15 rhythms",

    "vaultTitle": "The Vault — Secure Key Storage",
    "vaultBody": "The Vault provides AES-256-GCM encrypted storage for your personal API keys. This powers the Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) feature.\n\nWhat BYOK means:\nInstead of using the platform's AI credits, you can store your own API key in the Vault. When your warrior makes AI calls, it uses your key instead — giving you full control over your AI usage and billing.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Go to Dashboard and tap the Vault button\n2. Tap 'Add Key'\n3. Enter a label (e.g., 'My NVIDIA Key'), select the type, and paste your API key\n4. Optionally set an expiry date\n5. Your key is encrypted immediately — even we can't read it\n\nSecurity details:\n- Keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM (military-grade encryption)\n- Each key gets a unique initialization vector (IV)\n- Auth tags verify data integrity\n- Keys are only decrypted at the moment of use\n- The list view only shows a masked preview (e.g., 'nvapi-...xyz')\n\nKey limits by plan:\n- Trial: 0 keys (Pro required)\n- Pro: Up to 5 keys\n- Pro Tribe: Up to 10 keys",

    "questTitle": "WarriorQuest — Level Progression",
    "questBody": "WarriorQuest is a gamified progression system that rewards you for using the platform's features.\n\nHow it works:\nAs you use ClawWarriors, you automatically complete quests and earn XP (experience points). XP accumulates to unlock new levels and tier ranks.\n\nTier progression:\n- Recruit (Level 1-2): You're just getting started\n- Apprentice (Level 3-5): You've learned the basics\n- Warrior (Level 6-8): You're an experienced user\n- Commander (Level 9-10): You've mastered the platform\n\nExample quests:\n- First Steps (deploy your first warrior)\n- Voice Shaper (customize your Soul Forge)\n- Memory Keeper (accumulate 10+ memories)\n- Rhythm Master (create 3 active rhythms)\n- Identity Forged (set a custom warrior name)\n\nYour current level and XP progress are shown on your warrior card in the dashboard. The next quest to complete is highlighted in the quest nudge banner.\n\nQuests complete automatically — no manual claiming needed.",

    "webSearchTitle": "Web Search — Live Information",
    "webSearchBody": "Your warrior has a built-in web search capability that lets it access current, real-time information from the internet.\n\nHow it works:\nWhen you ask your warrior about recent events, current prices, latest news, or anything that requires up-to-date information, it automatically decides whether to search the web.\n\nYou don't need to do anything special — just ask naturally:\n- 'What's the weather like in Lisbon today?'\n- 'Find me the latest news about AI regulation'\n- 'What's the current price of Bitcoin?'\n\nThe AI model (powered by Kimi K2.5) handles web search internally and incorporates the results into its response.\n\nWeb search is available on all plans, including trial.",
